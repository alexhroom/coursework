# coursework
Repository for small code projects done as part of university coursework.

Countdown:
a Python project for first year Computing for Mathematics module. Takes a dictionary file, and simulates games of countdown finding the longest possible word for each board. the original short paper used this for an offbeat linguistics study, but I may use it with other dictionaries for other reasons.

Equilateral_polygons:
a project for second year Problem Solving module. the chosen project involved proving/disproving whether it was possible to create equilateral polygons with n sides, and we found it was possible to do so for even n. we then created an algorithm that did so, and I made a Jupyter notebook with a Python version.
